  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics by which urban areas attract visitors is significant for urban development in cities. In addition, identifying services that relate to highly attractive districts is useful to make policies regarding the placement of such places. Thus, we present a framework for classifying districts in cities by their attractiveness to visitors, and relating Points of Interests (POIs) types to districts' attraction patterns. We used Origin-Destination matrices (ODs) mined from cell phone data that capture the flow of trips between each pair of places in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We define the attraction profile for a place based on three main statistical features: The amount of visitors a place received, the distribution of distance traveled by visitors on the road network, and the spatial spread of where visitors come from. We use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify all places in the city by their features of attraction. We detect three types of Urban Attractors in Riyadh during the morning period: Global which are significant places in the city, Downtown which the central business district and Residential attractors. In addition, we uncover what makes these places different in terms of attraction patterns. We used a statistical significance testing approach to rigorously quantify the relationship between Points of Interests (POIs) types (services) and the 3 patterns of Urban Attractors we detected. The proposed framework can be used for detecting the attraction patterns given by type of services related to each pattern. This is a critical piece of information to inform trip distribution models.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential economic spillover effects of a home-sharing platform---Airbnb---on the growth of a complimentary local service---restaurants. By circumventing traditional land-use regulations and providing access to underutilized inventory, Airbnb attracts visitors to locales that are not traditional tourist destinations. Although visitors generally bring significant spending power, it is unclear whether visitors use Airbnb primarily for lodging and thus do not contribute to the adjacent economy. To evaluate this, we focus on the impact of Airbnb on the restaurant employment growth across locales in New York City (NYC). Specifically, we focus on areas in NYC that did not attract a significant tourist volume prior to the emergence of a home-sharing service. Our results indicate a salient and economically significant positive spillover effect on restaurant job growth in an average NYC locality. A one-percentage-point increase in the intensity of Airbnb activity (Airbnb reviews per household) leads to approximately 1.7\% restaurant employment growth. Since home-sharing visitors are lodging in areas that are not accustomed to tourists, we also investigate the demographic and market-structure-related heterogeneity of our results. Notably, restaurants in areas with a relatively high number of White residents disproportionately benefit from the economic spillover of Airbnb activity, whereas the impact in majority Black areas is not statistically significant. We validate the underlying mechanism behind the results by evaluating the impact of Airbnb on Yelp visitor reviews, revealing that areas with increased Airbnb activity experience a surge in their share of NYC visitor reviews. This result is further validated by evaluating the impact of a unique Airbnb neighborhood-level exogenous policy recently implemented in New Orleans.},

  abstract = {We assess the impact of home-sharing on residential house prices and rents. Using a dataset of Airbnb listings from the entire United States and an instrumental variables estimation strategy, we show that Airbnb has a positive impact on house prices and rents. This effect is stronger in zipcodes with a lower share of owner-occupiers, consistent with non-owner-occupiers being more likely to reallocate their homes from the long- to the short-term rental market. At the median owner-occupancy rate zipcode, we find that a 1\% increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.018\% increase in rents and a 0.026\% increase in house prices. Considering the median annual Airbnb growth in each zipcode, these results translate to an annual increase of \$9 in monthly rent and \$1,800 in house prices for the median zipcode in our data, which accounts for about one fifth of actual rent growth and about one seventh of actual price growth. Finally, we formally test whether the Airbnb effect is due to the reallocation of the housing supply. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, while the total supply of housing is not affected by the entry of Airbnb, Airbnb listings increase the supply of short-term rental units and decrease the supply of long-term rental units.},

  abstract = {City tourism is one of the fastest growing travel segments worldwide [18] and the changing nature of city tourism becomes increasingly apparent in many cities. Facilitated by mobile access to information, tourists are increasingly seeking, finding and consuming `local experiences' and the boundaries between tourists and residents become increasingly blurred. While the impact of the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the travel industry as well as on tourist behaviour and the travel experience has been widely acknowledged (Egger J Hosp Tour Technol 4(2): 119--133, 2013), (McCabe et al. Tour Manage Perspect 4: 36--44, 2012), (Stamboulis and Skayannis Tour Manage 24: 35--43, 2003), [35, 40], (Ye et al. Comput Hum Behav 27: 634--639, 2011), the implications of this new type of tourism for future urban development have received little attention (F{\"u}ller and Michel Int J Urban Regional 38(4): 1304--1318, 2014). This paper aims to better understand the underlying causes of the changing nature of city tourism and how this change could impact the future development of cities. It is argued that in addition to the proliferation of ICTs, the phenomena of experiential travel and social acceleration have contributed to the rise in popularity of city tourism as well as to a change in tourist behaviour. Possible implications for the future development of cities resulting from this new type of tourism, as well as approaches to solving those challenges, are discussed. It becomes clear that an interdisciplinary approach will be required in order to fully understand the challenges posed by city tourism as well as to develop and implement strategies for a successful integration of tourism into future urban development.},

I combine data from Airbnb and Zoopla and examine how the price of individual houses evolves over time, as Airbnb penetrates the market in the area of Greater London. Leveraging the fact that properties with more than three bedrooms are less exposed to Airbnb, I use a difference-in-differences strategy by year and house type. I find that a 10-percent increase in the number of Airbnb properties in a ward increases real rents by 0.1 percent. The effect of Airbnb is highest in one-bedroom properties because these smaller properties are substitutes for hotel rooms, inducing landlords to shift supply from long-let rental market to Airbnb.  The impact of Airbnb is heterogeneous, and areas that are more in demand by residents due to better quality schools show a more considerable increase in rents. Airbnb 的增长可能会减少房产供应，从而影响当地的住房租赁市场。我结合了 Airbnb 和 Zoopla 的数据，研究了随着 Airbnb 渗透到大伦敦地区的市场，个别房屋的价格如何随着时间的推移而变化。鉴于拥有三间以上卧室的房产较少受到 Airbnb 的影响，我根据年份和房屋类型采用了双重差异策略。我发现，一个行政区的 Airbnb 房产数量增加 10\%，实际租金就会增加 0.1\%。 Airbnb 对一居室房产的影响最大，因为这些较小的房产可以替代酒店房间，从而促使房东将供应从长租市场转移到 Airbnb。 Airbnb 的影响是多种多样的，由于学校质量更好而居民需求更大的地区租金涨幅更为显着。},

It employs spatial bivariate correlations and spatial econometrics to understand the heterogeneous spatial relationship between established hotels and Airbnb for three kinds of local tourism destinations: sun and beach, nature-based, and city. The case study concerns the Canary Islands where a good mixture of these attractions can be found. The main conclusion drawn is that Airbnb regulation needs to distinguish the kind of tourism. More precisely, Airbnb supply overlaps established hotels in city tourism, but it does not so clearly in sun and beach nor nature-based destinations. Airbnb supply matches tourist visits spatial distribution better than established hotels in city and nature-based destinations, but not in sun and beach destinations, where the incumbent hotels are closer to the tourism resources. Finally, the results from the spatial econometrics model shows that population size and the number of tourist visits matters as determinants of Airbnb location. However, the main determinant is price, which has got a much larger elasticity.},

  abstract = {The `sharing economy' has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of `sharing', the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities.},

Through the collection and analysis of both primary and secondary data (online survey, semi-structured interviews and document analysis), it seeks to explore whether local authorities have implemented policies towards sustainable tourism in the capital. The findings indicate that although the concept of sustainable tourism is perceived as important by policy makers, only a few local authorities in London promote its principles in their policy documents and even fewer have initiatives to put them in practice. Most of these initiatives are isolated activities which address limited aspects of sustainable tourism. The paper concludes that despite some progress made to date, in the current economic climate, growth and development remain the main objectives of governments and local authorities, while social and environmental issues are often left behind.},

The primary objectives guiding this research are as follows: to uncover the prevalent discussions and debates within the tourism and hospitality sector concerning the implications and effects of the sharing economy on urban destinations; and to analyse how scholarly inquiries and empirical investigations have contributed to a comprehensive comprehension of the intricate theoretical foundations and practical intricacies inherent in the sharing economy. This exploration takes place within the extensive expanse of existing literature.,The study used the non-conventional method for data mining. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool called www.dimensions.ai was used to mine data between the year 2002 and 2021. After which the data was analysed, using Citespace software that assisted in building themes for answering the research questions.,The sharing economy has multifaceted implications for rural and urban destinations. For instance, the findings demonstrated that emotional solidarity fosters community bonds between tourists and residents, enhancing authenticity. While, management firms optimise short-term rentals, boosting revenue and occupancy rates despite capped at 20\%. It further demonstrated that the sharing economy disrupts traditional accommodations, especially hotels, impacting rural and urban destinations differently based on location and regulatory flexibility. Technological advancements would shape the digital future, transforming the resource in sharing and connectivity in urban settings.,Management firms or agents significantly enhance property facilities, revenue and occupancy rates. Properties managed by professionals perform better in terms of revenue and occupancy; furthermore, traditional accommodations need innovative strategies to compete with sharing economy platforms. Policymakers must consider location-specific regulations to balance sharing economy impacts. Embracing technological advancements ensures urban destinations stay relevant and competitive.,Emotional solidarity fosters bonds between residents and tourists, contributing to a sense of community. Management firms contribute to local economies and stability. However, Airbnb's impact on traditional accommodations raises concerns about the effect on residents and communities.,The study incorporates classical sociology theory to understand emotional solidarity and extends the concept of moral economy to guide economic behaviour in the sharing economy. The analysis also underscores the influence of technological trends such as mobile technology, Internet of Things, AI and blockchain on sharing practices in reshaping existing theoretical frameworks in the sharing atmosphere. Furthermore, the co-creation of value theory highlights collaborative interactions between hosts and guests, shaping the sharing economy experience. Consumer segmentation and choice theories shed light on sharing economy dynamics. Institutional and location-based theories provide insights into regulatory and location-specific impacts.,This research contributes by comprehensively exploring the multifaceted implications of the sharing economy on a tourist destination. It delves into emotional solidarity, management firm roles and location-specific impacts, enriching the understanding of the sharing economy's effects. The application of co-creation of value theory and examination of platform technologies offer fresh perspectives on value creation and user engagement. The study's focus on practical dimensions guides stakeholders in optimising the benefits and addressing challenges posed by the sharing economy in urban contexts. The exploration of moral economy and its relevance to the sharing economy provides a novel perspective, while the examination of technological influences on sharing practices contributes to understanding the digital future of the sharing economy.},

  abstract = {London is an international tourist destination and one of the world's most well known tourist capitals. Over 23 million overseas and domestic visitors contributed {\pounds} 4700 million to the city's economy in 1987. In this paper, the implications of a continued growth in international and domestic tourism are considered in the light of recent predictions which envisage that London's overseas and domestic visitors will rise from 23 million in 1987 to 27 million in 1990. One of the most pressing issues which tourist agencies such as the London Tourist Board face, is directing some tourists to new areas and attractions away from the existing concentration in the West End of London. In this paper, the existing and proposed development of tourism in the East End of London (London Docklands) will beexamined as a new area with the potential to attract visitors from the West End. London Docklands has attracted international attention due to the prestigious and controversial regeneration of the area where commercial and residential development has been stimulated by a government funded Urban Development Corporation. Tourist and leisure developments seem set to bring a lasting economic benefit to the area though they have attracted very little attention to date.},

  abstract = {Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few years, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow among many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing information with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform. The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why, finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of "algorithmic regulation".},

  abstract = {The question of mobility is of immense importance in tourism research. Yet the current methods used to collect data on spatial and temporal activities are limited in accuracy and validity. Recent developments in the field of digital tracking technologies have produced a range of widely available systems, including land-based tracking, satellite navigation, and hybrid systems. The study reported here summarizes both the conventional and the new methods used to collect data on the spatial and temporal activities of tourists.

  abstract = {Over the past decade, Airbnb has emerged as the most popular platform for renting out single rooms or whole apartments. The impact of Airbnb listings on local neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and in particular urban tourism. We argue that urban tourism space can no longer be understood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist approach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a CSCW research direction that is concerned with the role of digital technologies in the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of representations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study, we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzk{\textbackslash}"olln and City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing descriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned places differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination management organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment. In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many places also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzk{\textbackslash}"olln, in contrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb, power relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs towards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.},
