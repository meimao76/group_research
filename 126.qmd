# 1. Airbnb in London: Challenges and Opportunities

## Background: Airbnb and London’s Tourism Landscape

Airbnb is a well-known shared accommodation platform that has significantly impacted the global tourism industry and short-term rental market[@chaudharyEffectsAirbnbHousing2021]. In London, **traditional tourist hotspots** such as Westminster and Camden are challenged by increasing overcrowding and housing pressures. At the same time, the rise of Airbnb has fuelled economic growth in **non-traditional tourism areas**, such as Hackney and East London, which were previously overlooked as major tourist destinations.[@airbnbNewReportTravel2023]

This shift highlights a key opportunity:

-   Can Airbnb's expansion into emerging areas help reduce congestion in traditional tourist hotspots while promoting economic benefits throughout the city?
-   What are the wider implications for housing availability, economic balance and tourism policy?

## Objectives: How Can Data Inform Better Tourism and Economic Policies?

To address these questions and provide data-driven insights for the Mayor of London's office, we used publicly available data from Inside Airbnb. The analysis focuses on:

1.  The **spatial distribution** of Airbnb listings in traditional and non-traditional tourist areas.
2.  The **economic impact** of Airbnb on regional retail and hospitality sectors.

The ultimate aim is to assess the effectiveness of the current short-term lets (STL) policy and to propose a strategy that supports **balanced tourism development** and ensures economic growth and sustainable housing supply in different parts of London.

# 2. Inside Airbnb: Uncovering the Story Behind the Data

The data used in this analysis is sourced from **Inside Airbnb**, covering the past twelve months of *Airbnb listings* in London.

## **Q1. Who collected the InsideAirbnb data?**

InsideAirbnb data was collected by Murray Cox and his collaborators. As discussed on [@2024] Inside Airbnb was founded by Murray Cox, an artist, activist and technologist who conceived the project, compiled and analysed the data and built the site.

## **Q2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data?**

The Inside Airbnb data was collected to:

-   \*\*\*\*\*\*Understand the impact of STL\*\* on local communities and housing markets.
-   **Support policymakers and researchers** with transparent data for informed decisions.
-   **Raise public awareness** and promote responsible short-term rental policies and practices.

## **Q3. How did they collect it?**

Inside Airbnb collects publicly available data from the Airbnb website, including listing details, availability calendars (365 days), and reviews. The data is then:

1.  **Cleaned:** Verified, anonymised (locations within 150 meters), and corrected for accuracy.
2.  **Aggregated:** Summarized to provide key metrics for visualisation and analysis.
3.  **Analysed:** Occupancy models estimate rental frequency and income, with filters applied to highlight highly available and frequently booked listings.

The site uses open-source tools like Python, PostgreSQL, and Mapbox to process and present the data for public research and policy discussions.

## **Q4. How does the method of collection (Q3) impact the completeness and/or accuracy of the InsideAirbnb data? How well does it represent the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?**

1.  Completeness & Accuracy:

-   \*Sampling Limitations: \*\* Web scraping captures only publicly available listings, excluding private, removed, or hidden rentals.
-   \*Dynamic Data: \*\* Listings change frequently, so snapshots may not reflect real-time trends.
-   \*Data Quality: \*\* Errors in scraping or Airbnb's platform can affect reliability.

2.  Representation:

The data highlights trends but misses local market dynamics and host behaviors. Regional variations limit broader applicability.

3.  Wider Issues:

-   \*Policy Risks: \*\*Incomplete data can lead to misguided policies.
-   \*Privacy: \*\* Ethical concerns arise around data ownership and usage.
-   \*Bias: \*\* Data motivations may influence analysis.

## **Q5. What ethical considerations does the use of the InsideAirbnb data raise?**

1.  **Privacy:** Publicly scraped data includes host details, raising concerns about consent and privacy.
2.  **Data Misuse:** Misinterpretation can lead to flawed conclusions or biased policies.
3.  **Community Impact:** Highlighting certain areas may stigmatise hosts or neighbourhoods, exacerbating tensions.
4.  **Discrimination:** Regulatory scrutiny may unfairly target specific communities.
5.  **Transparency:** Data collection methods and biases must be clear to ensure accountability.
6.  **Long-Term Effects:** Policy decisions based on incomplete data can harm housing affordability and vulnerable populations.

# Conclution: What could we do?

## Findings

**About Inside Airbnb:**

Inside Airbnb provides publicly available information, offering transparency, revealing trends in the short-term rental (STL) market, and supporting spatial analysis and policy-making with flexibility and accessibility.

However, as it excludes hidden or private listings and is frequently updated, the data may lack completeness and accuracy, while also raising privacy and ethical concerns regarding its use.

**About Short Term Lets:**

A small number of landlords control most short-term rentals, which far outnumber hotels. These rentals are concentrated in central London, clustering in traditional tourist areas and spreading to non-traditional zones.

**About Economy:**

Airbnb density acctually reduces tourism economy. When too many Airbnb listings appear in non-traditional tourist areas, they exceed what the local economy can handle. 

Excessively high Airbnb density weakens the quality of local tourism services, pushes up housing prices and rents, displaces long-term residents, and increases pressure on local communities and resources.[@barronEffectHomeSharingHouse2020]

## How could the InsideAirbnb data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?

**Revealing the overall trends in the short-term rental market**

Using Inside Airbnb's geographic data, the distribution patterns of short-term rentals can be observed, helping the government identify hotspot areas for targeted planning and regulation.[@ferreriPlatformEconomiesUrban2018a]

With quarterly updates, Inside Airbnb also enables the analysis of temporal changes in the market, supporting enhanced monitoring and management during peak periods.[@quattroneWhoBenefitsSharing2016]

**Evaluating the Impact on the Long-Term Rental Market**

Using rental price from Inside Airbnb, combined with the ratio of short-term to long-term rentals, the impact of short-term rentals on the local market can be assessed. This analysis highlights potential pressures on the long-term rental market and supports policy development to protect long-term housing.[@finckSharingCity2016]

**Evaluating Social Impacts**

By analyzing socio-economic data, such as tourism revenue, population density, and rental prices, the broader social impacts of the short-term rental market can be identified. This enables the development of region-specific policies tailored to local characteristics.

**Monitoring and Enforcement Guidelines** 

- **90-Day Rule:** Inside Airbnb data, including availability calendars and booking records, can help identify violations of the 90-day rental limit.[@@finckSharingCity2016]  

- **Data Sharing and Enforcement:** The data enables targeted enforcement by local governments, focusing on high-risk listings and implementing stricter policies or taxes for multi-listing hosts.  

- **Technological Applications:** Integrating Inside Airbnb data with government records (e.g., tax and property registries) can create a unified monitoring system. Machine learning models can predict high-risk violations, while automated tools (e.g., web crawlers) can continuously track new listings and host activities.[@quattroneWhoBenefitsSharing2016] 

## What can we do for London’s Short-Term Lets?

- **Property Registration System:** Increase market transparency, facilitate governmental oversight, and support enforcement.

- **Differentiated Regulation:** Introduce listing caps or growth limits in non-traditional tourist areas alongside infrastructure and service investments, improving local attractiveness.

- **Operational Limits:** Restrict excessive short-term rental commercialization to maintain a balanced market and mitigate negative impacts on hotels and long-term housing.
