# 1. Airbnb in London: Challenges and Opportunities

## 1.1 Background: Airbnb and London’s Tourism Landscape

Airbnb is a well-known shared accommodation platform that has had a significant impact on the global tourism industry and short-term rental market (Chaudhary, 2021). In London, **traditional tourist hotspots** such as Westminster and Camden are challenged by increasing overcrowding and housing pressures. At the same time, the rise of Airbnb has fuelled economic growth in **non-traditional tourism areas**, such as Hackney and East London, which were previously overlooked as major tourist destinations (Airbnb, 2023).

This shift highlights a key opportunity:

- Can Airbnb's expansion into emerging areas help reduce congestion in traditional tourist hotspots while promoting economic benefits throughout the city?
- What are the wider implications for housing availability, economic balance and tourism policy?

## 1.2 Objectives: How Can Data Inform Better Tourism and Economic Policies?

To address these questions and provide data-driven insights for the Mayor of London's office, we used publicly available data from Inside Airbnb. The analysis focuses on:

1. The **spatial distribution** of Airbnb listings in traditional and non-traditional tourist areas.
2. The **economic impact** of Airbnb on regional retail and hospitality sectors.

The ultimate aim is to assess the effectiveness of the current short-term lets (STL) policy and to propose a strategy that supports **balanced tourism development** and ensures economic growth and sustainable housing supply in different parts of London.
